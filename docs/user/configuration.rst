Configuration
=============

.. automodule:: turses.config


The configuration file is divided into sections, each of which is described
below these lines.

Timelines
---------

This sections allows you to configure which timelines are created when
``turses`` is launched. The default timelines are:

- home: The tweets and retweets from the people you follow.
- own_tweets: Your own tweets and retweets.
- messages: Messages sent to and from you.
- favorites: Your favorited tweets.
- mentions: Tweets mentioning you.

You can controll wether a timeline is created at startup assigning ``true`` or
``false`` to the name of the timeline in the ``timelines`` section.

An example configuration with only the ``home`` and ``mentions`` timeline
active:


::

    [timelines]
    home = true
    own_tweets = false
    messages = false
    favorites = false
    mentions = true


Twitter
-------

This section allows you to configure the settings related to the Twitter API.
The only available option is ``update_frequency`` which controls how often (in
seconds) the timelines should be automatically updated.

An example configuration that updates the timelines every minute:

::

    [twitter]
    update_frequency = 60


Bindings
--------

Almost every action within ``turses`` is configurable. The defaults resemble
some of the bindings from the ``vi`` editor. To see an up-to-date description
of all the available actions open the help buffer pressing ``?``.

An example configuration with the motion keys assigned to the arrow keys:

::

    [bindings]
    up = up
    down = down
    left = left
    right = right

``turses`` uses the representation of keystrokes provided by `urwid <http://excess.org/urwid/>`_ to
map the bindings to actions.

Colors
------

You can change the colors of different elements of the UI in ``turses``. The
legal values for colors are listed in the `urwid wiki <http://excess.org/urwid/wiki/DisplayAttributes>`_.

An example configuration that sets a magenta background and white foreground in
the editor:

::

    [colors]
    editor = white
    editor_bg = dark magenta

Styles
------

This section allows you to onfigure the styles for some of the UI elements in
``turses``. Below is a description of all the configuration options in the
section.

Templates
~~~~~~~~~

The templates allow you to configure how certain text is rendered in ``turses``.
The following templates are available:

- ``header_template``: The header of a tweet.
- ``dm_template``: The header of a direct message.
- ``tab_template``: The text in a tab.

This templates contain variables enclosed between braces that are replaced by
their corresponding value. Let's look at the defaults to see all the available
variables within the templates:

::

    [styles]
    header_template =  {username}{retweeted}{retweeter} - {time}{reply} {retweet_count}

- ``username``: The author of the tweet.
- ``retweeted``: ♻ symbol indicating that the tweet is a retweet.
- ``retweeter``: The name of the retweeter (if any).
- ``time``: Relative time of the tweet.
- ``reply``: ✉ symbol indicating that the tweet is a reply.
- ``retweet_count``: The number of retweets.

::

    [styles]
    dm_template =  {sender_screen_name} => {recipient_screen_name} - {time}

- ``sender_screen_name``: The sender of the message.
- ``recipient_screen_name``: The recipient of the message.
- ``time``: Relative time of the message.

::

    [styles]
    tab_template = {unread} {timeline_name}

- ``unread``: Unread tweet count.
- ``timeline_name``: The name of the timeline.

Tweets
~~~~~~

You can configure how tweets are rendered. By default the statuses are enclosed
in a box, but you can use a divider instead.

Here's how the default configuration for status styles looks like:

::

    [styles]
    box_around_status = true

If ``box_around_status`` is set to ``true``, the tweets will be rendered as
follows:

.. image:: ../images/box_around_status.png
    :width: 900px
    :height: 600px
    :align: center
    :alt: tweets rendered with a box around them


When setting ``box_around_status`` to ``false`` you can specify a divider
character that will be printed below the statuses.

.. warning:: The ``box_around_status`` option has precedence over
   ``status_divider``

::

    [styles]
    box_around_status = false
    status_divider = false
    status_divider_char = ─

This is how it looks like using ``─`` as a status divider:

.. image:: ../images/status_divider.png
    :width: 900px
    :height: 600px
    :align: center
    :alt: tweets rendered with a status divider

Editor
~~~~~~

You can also configure the position of the editor in the screen modifyng the
``editor_horizontal_align`` and ``editor_vertical_align`` options. The accepted
values for this options are the following:

- ``editor_horizontal_aling``: ``left``, ``center`` or ``right``
- ``editor_vertical_aling``: ``top``, ``middle`` or ``bottom``

An example configuration with the editor positioned in the center of the
screen:

::

    [styles]
    editor_horizontal_align = center
    editor_vertical_align = middle

Here's how it looks like:

.. image:: ../images/editor_middle.png
    :width: 900px
    :height: 600px
    :align: center
    :alt: tweets rendered with a status divider

Url format
~~~~~~~~~~

You can choose how URLs are rendered tweaking the ``url_format`` option in the
``styles`` section. The following formats are available:

- ``shortened``: URL shortened by Twitter (e.g. ``t.co/foo``)
- ``original``: Full original URL (e.g. ``http://example.com/``)
- ``display``: Original URL with an ellipsis if it's too long and trimming the
    protocol prefix (e.g. ``example.com/a-very-long-⋯``)

The default option is ``display``. Here's an example of a configuration option
to display the full original URLs:

::

    [styles]
    url_format = original

Debug
-----

The last section of the configuration is ``debug``, which is intended for
developers.

::

    [debug]
    logging_level = 3
